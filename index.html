<h2>Project</h2>

<div class="column width2 first">

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
One day, one night, a manager had an idea: create a website to help people 
in IT technologies. The site must allow users to ask questions through 
threads and users can respond and vote for the best answer.
</p>

<p>
Because information technologies are very diverse, the manager wants to 
assign to each thread some tags to find and classify them.
</p>

<h3>Pages</h3>

<p>
Once the site is completed, it will consist of the following pages:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Home<br/>
This page contains the welcome message from the manager for visitors and highlights the “hottest” thread of the website.
</li>
<li>
Thread list<br/>
This page will provide thread list created by users. The search by name may also be possible. Each item in the list consists of the thread name as well as the first characters of the question.
</li>
<li>
Thread details<br/>
This page is used to display the thread selected: the name and the tags as well as comments left by users with a system rating for each one. This page must contain a form to leave a comment. 
</li>
</ul>
